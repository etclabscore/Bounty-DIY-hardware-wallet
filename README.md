## The Problem

Need for an easy to use frontend for [Signatory Server](https://signatory.dev).

## The Goal

Signatory Hardware Wallet Client (`/frontend`):

- [ ] Installs and managers a `/daemon` in a remote node, ideally, a home raspberry pi.
- [ ] Creates Hierarchical Wallets from imported/created mnemonic phrases or keystore files
- [ ] Provides ability to sign and verify messages
- [ ] Provides ability to sign transactions

It is greatly inspired by [MyCrypto Wallet](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto), an electronjs client for generating ether wallets, handling ERC-20 tokens, and interacting with the blockchain more easily.
